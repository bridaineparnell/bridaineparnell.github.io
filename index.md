I'm currently pursuing a PhD in responsible natural language processing and artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on narratives and communication in AI, tecnology ethics and regulation, and the social impact of AI and NLP. I'm interested in how the stories we tell about technology today influences the design and regulation of the technologies of tomorrow.

## Recent research

- How have the stories told by the AI industry about AI as a technology influenced the formation of the EU AI Act?

My masters' thesis asks if the narratives that surround AI as a technology, in media reports, interviews and even submissions of evidence to the EU Commission, could have influenced how policymakers thought about what they needed to regulate and how they would do it. In particular, prevailing stories that AI will definitely progress until it reaches general intelligence, that it will lead to either utopia or dystopia, and that it's a zero-sum game, if 'we' don't get there first, someone else wil reap the rewards.

## Background

- MA English Literature, MSc Narrative Futures
- 15+ years in journalism and content marketing, primarily as an economic, finance and technology specialist.
